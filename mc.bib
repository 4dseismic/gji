Abstract = {{The South Iceland Lowland (SIL) data acquisition system presently
   consists of 33 digital, three component seismic stations connected to a
   common data center. The automatic, on-line, earthquake analysis
   performed by the SIL network can be divided into three categories. (1)
   Single-station analysis performed at the site stations producing
   information about all incoming phases. A short message with data on the
   phase is sent to the center. (2) Multi-station analysis done at the
   center, using the phase reports from the stations and producing
   information about all detected events including estimates of location,
   magnitude and fault plane solutions. (3) Alert reporting to notify the
   operators of the network in cases of a priori defined changes in
   parameters derived from the single- and multi-station analysis. The
   system is designed for maximum automatic operation and minimum
   operational cost and has shown to be capable of automatic evaluation of
   more then 1000 earthquakes per day or episodically several earthquakes
   per minute. While no attempt is made to detect and locate teleseismic
   events, teleseismic data is automatically saved, based on e-mail
   messages from global seismological networks. Groups of events are
   analyzed using correlation techniques to obtain accurate absolute and
   relative locations of earthquakes with similar waveforms. In some areas
   within the network, most of the earthquakes correlate very highly with
   each other. Based on this a new approach is being taken regarding the
   automatic operation of the network. A geographically indexed data base
   will be created where different classes of earthquakes an stored. As new
   earthquakes are recorded by the network the system automatically looks
   for similar waveforms in this data base and, if found, takes the onset
   and first motion direction picks from there. The algorithm is planned to
   be implemented in late 1999. New methods have been developed to estimate
   the stress tensor based only on the microearthquake focal mechanisms and
   accurate relative locations. This is planned to be implemented into the
   automatic on-line procedures. Methods and related software are being
   developed for real-time monitoring of fault movements based on the high
   accuracy locations and fault plane solutions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science
